# Notes Application

This is a notes application built using the MERN stack, with login and signup secured using JWT. Users can easily add notes, keep track of their tasks and important things, and delete completed tasks with a simple UI. I built this project during the early stages of learning MERN, and it helped me gain a lot of new insights.
